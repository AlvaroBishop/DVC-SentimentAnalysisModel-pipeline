# Sentiment Analysis Model using Logistic Regression

This project aims to develop a sentiment analysis model using logistic regression. The model is designed to predict the sentiment (positive or negative) of movie reviews. It serves as a simple demonstration of implementing a machine learning pipeline using DVC (Data Version Control).

## Dataset:

The dataset used for this project is the "IMDB Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews" available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews). It consists of 50,000 movie reviews labeled as positive or negative.

## Model Architecture

The sentiment analysis model is based on logistic regression. Logistic regression is a simple and effective algorithm for binary classification tasks like sentiment analysis. It models the probability of a certain class (positive or negative sentiment) given the input features (text data from movie reviews).

## DVC Pipelines

Data Version Control (DVC) pipelines are used in this project to manage the workflow. DVC pipelines help in organizing and automating the stages involved in training and evaluating the model. The pipeline includes stages for data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and model evaluation.

This project serves as a demonstration of building a sentiment analysis model using logistic regression and implementing DVC pipelines for workflow management.
